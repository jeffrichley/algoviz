## Instructions

### 1. Analysis Phase
- **Read and understand** the target file completely
- **Identify root causes** of each issue type
- **Prioritize fixes** by impact and dependencies
- **Check for conflicts** between different fix types

### 2. Fix Strategy
- **Start with imports** (ruff I001, F401, F403, F405)
- **Fix whitespace issues** (ruff W291, W292, W293) 
- **Address unused variables** (ruff F841)
- **Resolve type issues** (mypy errors)
- **Reduce complexity** (xenon violations)
- **Improve test coverage** (pytest gaps)

### 3. Implementation Requirements
- **Produce a unified diff** that resolves ALL listed issues
- **Maintain existing functionality** - no breaking changes
- **Follow Python best practices** and PEP 8
- **Preserve code style** and formatting preferences
- **Add type hints** where missing (mypy issues)
- **Refactor complex functions** (xenon issues)
- **Add missing tests** (pytest coverage)

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Ensure fixes don't introduce new issues
- Verify imports are properly organized
- Check that type hints are accurate
- Confirm complexity is reduced appropriately
- Validate test coverage improvements

## Response Format

**If changes are needed, respond with JSON:**
```json
{
  "diff": "unified diff patch here",
  "explanation": {
    "summary": "Brief overview of what was fixed",
    "fixes": {
      "ruff": ["Fixed W293: removed whitespace from blank lines", "Fixed F401: removed unused imports"],
      "mypy": ["Added type hints to function parameters"],
      "xenon": ["Refactored complex function into smaller functions"],
      "pytest": ["Added missing test cases for edge conditions"]
    },
    "risks": "Any potential risks or breaking changes",
    "verification": "How to verify the fixes work correctly"
  }
}
```

**If no changes are needed, respond with:**
```
NO CHANGES NEEDED
```

## Important Notes
- **Be conservative** - only fix what's explicitly listed
- **Maintain compatibility** - don't change public APIs
- **Follow existing patterns** - match the codebase style
- **Explain reasoning** - document why each fix was made
- **Test thoroughly** - ensure fixes don't break existing functionality

**Remember:** You're fixing real production code. Quality and safety over speed!
